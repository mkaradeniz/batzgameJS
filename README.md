- Chapter 2

## Known Issues
- `yarn build` will not work out-of-the box because a dependency of [Terminal in React](https://github.com/nitin42/terminal-in-react) ([camelcase](https://github.com/sindresorhus/camelcase)) will [not use ES5](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ama/issues/446) in their package. One workaround is to manually transpile the index.js in `node_modules\terminal-in-react\node_modules\camelcase`. This is so JS.
